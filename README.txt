# MNIST Neural Networks in Docker

This project contains two Jupyter notebooks where I experiment with neural networks on the MNIST dataset.

- `oneLayer.ipynb` → Logistic regression built from scratch (no ML frameworks).
- `MLP-classifier.ipynb` → Multi-layer perceptron using PyTorch.

## Run in Docker

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThinCalligrapher/mnist-docker.git
   cd mnist-docker
